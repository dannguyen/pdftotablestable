# PDF-to-Tables Table

Making a table to compare how well tools extract tabular data from PDFs.

Todo: Come up with a methodology (what's the baseline?) to compare the results across tools. Fidelity to table structure is the main goal, but not the only way that tools differ.

Todo: Just collected PDFs and tools. Testing to come.

## Tools

- [Tabula-Java](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java): the scriptable engine behind Tabula, via OpenCollective.
- [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber): a high-level Python interface to pdfminer, created by Jerm-Sing-Vine
- [PDFTables.com](https://pdftables.com/) - a cloud service from the Sensible Code Company
- [CometDocs](https://www.cometdocs.com/) - a cloud service with PDF-to-XLS functionality
- [ABBYY FineReader Pro for Mac](https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/finereader/pro-for-mac/) - What I personally use. Costs money. No idea if it differs via cross-platform. Has no automatable-interface. But very accurate and dependable.
- [ZamZar](http://www.zamzar.com/): Provides pdf-to-table functionality at the level of Google Drive, which is to say, not much at all. Might include it just as a baseline.
- [pdftotext](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/): part of the Poppler suite. Its `-layout` option provides a conversion that attempts to visually emulate the original PDF, but the result is not delimited data.

## Benchmark PDFs

Trying to collect publicly-available PDFs that exhibit a wide-range of real-world data-as-PDF characteristics. Feel free to suggest some!

Note: not interested in PDFs that contain _scanned_ documents. Of the tools we're testing, only ABBYY has OCR-to-Excel functionality.
